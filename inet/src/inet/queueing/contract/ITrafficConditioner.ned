// This module interface is implemented by traffic conditioner modules. A traffic
// conditioner connects one input to one output. It operates in passive mode on
// its input and in active mode on its output. Packets can be pushed into its
// input and packets can be pulled from its output. A traffic conditioner can
// drop, delay and reorder packets, but it doesn't modify packets in any way.
